# About Painting

*Published on January 15, 2024*

I seem to have some connection with painting. When I was a child, I went to the library not to read literature, but to read comics.

## Early Memories

I remember that when I was in elementary school, I would go to the library every weekend to borrow comic books. The colorful illustrations and engaging stories captivated my imagination. I would spend hours copying my favorite characters, trying to recreate the dynamic poses and expressive faces.

My parents were initially concerned that I was spending too much time with "picture books" instead of "real books." But looking back, those comics taught me so much about visual storytelling, composition, and character design.

## The Evolution

As I grew older, my interest in visual art evolved. I discovered digital painting and graphic design, which opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities. The ability to blend traditional artistic techniques with modern technology fascinated me.

I started experimenting with:
- Digital illustration software like Photoshop and Procreate
- Vector graphics with Illustrator
- 3D modeling and rendering
- Animation and motion graphics
- UI/UX design principles

## Finding the Intersection

What I love most about my journey is how painting and visual creativity have merged with my technical work. In web development and design, every pixel matters. Color theory, composition, and visual hierarchy—all the principles I learned from studying art—directly apply to creating beautiful user interfaces.

## The Creative Process

My approach to both art and code follows a similar pattern:

1. **Inspiration**: Gathering references and ideas
2. **Sketching**: Quick iterations and experimentation
3. **Refinement**: Polishing details and perfecting execution
4. **Reflection**: Learning from what worked and what didn't

Whether I'm painting a landscape or designing a website, the creative process remains fundamentally the same.

## Art in Technology

Today, I continue to explore the intersection of art and technology in my work. Whether it's:
- Designing user interfaces that are both beautiful and functional
- Creating illustrations for web applications
- Experimenting with generative art and creative coding
- Building interactive visualizations

Painting and visual creativity remain at the core of what I do.

## Lessons Learned

Through years of practice, I've learned that:

- **Constraints breed creativity**: Limited color palettes or canvas sizes force innovative solutions
- **Fundamentals matter**: Understanding basic principles allows you to break rules effectively
- **Practice is essential**: Regular sketching and experimentation keep skills sharp
- **Inspiration is everywhere**: From nature to architecture to everyday objects
- **Sharing is important**: Getting feedback and learning from others accelerates growth

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to continue exploring new mediums and techniques. The boundary between traditional art and digital creation continues to blur, offering endless possibilities for creative expression.

My childhood love of comics has evolved into a career where I get to combine artistic vision with technical skill every single day. And I still make time to visit the library—though now I'm just as likely to check out books on design theory as I am to browse the graphic novel section.
