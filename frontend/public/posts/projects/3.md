- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- spaCy for NLP preprocessing
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT-based models)
- scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms

### Backend Services
- FastAPI for REST API
- PostgreSQL for conversation history
- MongoDB for unstructured data
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Celery for async task processing

### Frontend Interface
- React for web chat widget
- Socket.io for real-time messaging
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android

## Core Features

### Natural Language Understanding
- Intent classification with 95% accuracy
- Entity extraction for key information
- Sentiment analysis for escalation
- Multi-language support (English, Chinese, Spanish)
- Context-aware responses

### Conversation Management
- Multi-turn dialogue handling
- Context retention across sessions
- Fallback mechanisms for unknown queries
- Seamless handoff to human agents
- Conversation history and analytics

### Knowledge Base Integration
- FAQ database with 1000+ entries
- Product documentation search
- Order status lookup
- Account management capabilities
- Dynamic content updates

### Learning & Improvement
- Continuous learning from conversations
- A/B testing for response variations
- Feedback collection and analysis
- Regular model retraining
- Performance monitoring dashboard

## Model Development

### Data Collection
- Gathered 100,000+ customer service conversations
- Annotated 10,000 conversations for training
- Created synthetic data for edge cases
- Balanced dataset across intents

### Training Process
- Fine-tuned BERT model on domain-specific data
- Implemented transfer learning techniques
- Used data augmentation for robustness
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

### Model Performance
- Intent classification accuracy: 95%
- Entity extraction F1 score: 0.92
- Average response time: 200ms
- Customer satisfaction: 4.5/5
- Resolution rate: 80%

## Integration & Deployment

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for chat interactions
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Webhook support for third-party integrations
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Deployment Strategy
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
