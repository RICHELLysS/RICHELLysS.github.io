# Cloud Infrastructure Migration

## Project Overview

Led the migration of legacy on-premise systems to cloud infrastructure, improving scalability, reliability, and reducing operational costs by 40%. This comprehensive project involved moving critical business applications to AWS while ensuring zero downtime.

## Migration Strategy

### Assessment Phase
- Inventory of all applications and dependencies
- Performance baseline measurements
- Security and compliance requirements
- Cost analysis and ROI projections
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning

### Planning Phase
- Application prioritization (6 R's strategy)
- Architecture redesign for cloud-native patterns
- Data migration strategy
- Rollback procedures
- Training and documentation plans

### Execution Phase
- Pilot migration with non-critical apps
- Phased migration approach
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Post-migration validation
- Knowledge transfer

## Technical Architecture

### AWS Services Used
- **Compute**: EC2, ECS, Lambda
- **Storage**: S3, EBS, EFS
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL), DynamoDB
- **Networking**: VPC, Route 53, CloudFront
- **Security**: IAM, KMS, WAF, Shield
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray
- **CI/CD**: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- CloudFormation for AWS-specific resources
- Ansible for configuration management
- Version control with Git
- Automated testing and validation

- Auto-scaling groups for dynamic workloads
- Load balancing across availability zones
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Elastic resource allocation
- Global content delivery

### Reliability
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Fault-tolerant architecture
- Self-healing systems

### Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation with VPCs
- Identity and access management
- Security group configurations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR

### Cost Optimization
- Right-sizing of instances
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Spot instances for batch processing
- S3 lifecycle policies
- CloudWatch cost monitoring
- Resource tagging and allocation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Small**: Pilot projects reduce risk
2. **Automate Everything**: Manual processes don't scale
3. **Security First**: Build security in from the start
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Visibility is crucial
5. **Document Thoroughly**: Knowledge sharing is essential
6. **Train Teams**: Invest in people development
7. **Plan for Costs**: Cloud costs can spiral without governance
