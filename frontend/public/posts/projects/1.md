# Sustainable Transport Tool

## Project Overview

Led the product discovery and UI/UX design for an MVP navigation app promoting eco-friendly travel options. This project aimed to make sustainable transportation choices more accessible and appealing to urban commuters.

## Key Features

### Route Optimization
- Multi-modal transport integration (walking, cycling, public transit)
- Carbon footprint calculation for each route option
- Real-time transit data integration
- Weather-aware route suggestions

### User Experience Design
- Intuitive interface with clear visual hierarchy
- Gamification elements to encourage sustainable choices
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences
- Achievement system for eco-friendly travel milestones

### Technical Implementation
- React Native for cross-platform mobile development
- Google Maps API integration
- Real-time data processing
- Local storage for offline functionality

## Design Process

### Research Phase
Conducted user interviews with 50+ daily commuters to understand pain points and motivations for choosing sustainable transport. Key findings included:
- Users want convenience over environmental impact
- Cost savings are a major motivator
- Social proof influences behavior

### Prototyping
Created high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, iterating through 5 major versions based on user feedback. Focus on:
- Minimizing cognitive load
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Accessible color schemes (WCAG AA compliant)

### Testing
Ran usability tests with 30 participants, achieving:
- 92% task completion rate
- Average SUS score of 78 (Good)
- Positive feedback on visual design and ease of use

## Impact

- 10,000+ downloads in first 3 months
- 25% increase in public transit usage among active users
- Featured in local sustainability initiatives
- Reduced average carbon footprint by 15kg CO2/user/month

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- TypeScript
- Google Maps API
- Firebase
- Redux for state management
- Jest for testing

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Integrating multiple transit APIs with inconsistent data formats
**Solution**: Built a unified data layer with normalization logic and fallback mechanisms

**Challenge**: Battery consumption from constant location tracking
**Solution**: Implemented smart location updates using geofencing and activity recognition

**Challenge**: User adoption and retention
**Solution**: Added social features and gamification to create habit-forming behaviors

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with bike-sharing and car-sharing services
- AI-powered route predictions based on historical patterns
- Community features for carpooling
- Carbon offset marketplace integration
