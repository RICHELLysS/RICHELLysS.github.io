- **Deployment**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

## Dashboard Features

### Real-time Metrics
- Live data updates every 5 seconds
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Historical data comparison
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Anomaly detection alerts

### Interactive Visualizations
- Line charts for time-series data
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Pie charts for distribution analysis
- Heatmaps for correlation matrices
- Geographic maps for location data
- Network graphs for relationship visualization

### Customization Options
- Drag-and-drop dashboard builder
- Custom widget creation
- Saved dashboard templates
- Personalized views per user
- Theme customization
- Export to PDF/PNG/CSV

### Data Analysis Tools
- Filtering and segmentation
- Drill-down capabilities
- Cross-filtering across widgets
- Custom calculated metrics
- Statistical analysis functions
- Predictive analytics

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline
1. Data ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, databases, files)
2. ETL processing with Apache Airflow
3. Data validation and cleaning
4. Storage in optimized formats
5. Caching layer for performance
6. Real-time streaming with Kafka

### Performance Optimization
